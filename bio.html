                    Kendrick Lamar Duckworth was born on june 17, 1987, in Compton California, to Kenneth “Kenny”
                    Duckworth, a former gang member, and Paula Oliver, a hairdresser. Named after Eddie Kendricks of The
                    Temptations, Lamar grew up in a challenging environment marked by gang violence and poverty. His
                    parents had moved to Compton from Chicago to escape the city’s gang culture, but Lamar still
                    witnessed the harsh realities of street life, including police brutality and murders, which deeply
                    influenced his worldview and later his music.

                As a child, Lamar was quiet and introspective, excelling academically despite a stutter. His love for
                writing was nurtured by his seventh-grade teacher, Mr. Inge, who introduced him to poetry and creative
                writing. This early exposure to storytelling and metaphors laid the foundation for his future as a
                lyricist.<br><br>

                Lamar began rapping under the name K-Dot in high school, releasing his first mixtape, Y.H.N.I.C. (Hub
                City Threat: Minor of the Year), at age 16. His talent caught the attention of Anthony “Top Dawg”
                Tiffith, who signed him to Top Dawg Entertainment(TDE) in 2005.<br><br>

                In 2011, Lamar released his debut studio album, Section.80, which explored themes of racism, violence
                and addiction. The album’s critical success led to collaborations with industry heavyweights like Dr.
                Dre signed him to Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records.<br><br>

                <p>
                Lamar’s major-label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city (2012) was a concept album that narrated his
                coming-of-age story in competition. It received widespread acclaim, earning seven grammy nominations.
                The song/poem I have chosen comes from this specific album and explores the complex relationship between
                poverty, ambition, and the pursuit of the American Dream in Compton. The song dives deep into the psyche
                of individuals trapped in a cycle of hardship, where the allure of wealth and the desperation to escape
                their circumstances intertwine.<br><br>
