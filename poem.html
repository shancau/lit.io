                <p>
                    The jeepney’s tired hum eats the road’s cracks—<br>
                    plastic saints sway, their gold crowns flaking paint.<br>
                    Lolo’s hands carve stories from storm-warped wood,<br>
                    while the sea spits back nets full of ghost crabs<br>
                    and the peso’s weight shrinks like drying fish.<br>
                    We kneel to coconuts, not crosses.

                    <br></br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roofs sag like Grandma’s spine,<br>
                    her palms cracked from husking hope<br>
                    into bowls of rice that never swell.<br>
                    Back when palm wine dripped sweeter than sermons,<br>
                    we’d ditch school to chase bike taxis<br>
                    down roads where resorts rise like tombstones,<br>
                    “Private” signs nailed where our footprints bled.

                    <br></br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the trees don’t judge.<br>
                    Their trunks twist like old men’s fists,<br>
                    roots clawing graves the tides stole.<br>
                    We climb anyway, skin raw from the hunger<br>
                    for a sky taller than tin-roofed mornings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everybody knows the cop’s cut,<br>
                    but his smirk gleams brighter than patrol lights.<br>
                    Coconut trees, they don’t lie—<br>
                    their shade hides the machete’s kiss on bark,<br>
                    sap slow as Grandpa’s tales of harvests<br>
                    that once bought shoes, not just salt.

                    <br></br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now kids scroll dreams on cracked screens,<br>
                    filming waves for clout, tagging Dubai<br>
                    while chain saws hum a hymn to the grove’s end.<br>
                    The priest preaches patience.<br>
                    The trees just grow.<br>
                    A dog barks. A knife grins. The sun don’t care.
